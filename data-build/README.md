# How the project's data were made

The files in `data/examples/per3/` are small pieces of large public data sets. These scripts made them, on
21 October 2026, from the sources named in each. They are here so that the data can be checked and remade (for
instance when the sources are updated) – students do not need them.

They need a Linux or macOS computer with `bcftools`, `samtools`, `tabix`/`bgzip` (htslib, with network access),
`seqtk`, `curl`, Python 3 and, for the primates, BLAST+. Each script writes into the folder it is given:

```bash
mkdir out
bash 01_reference.sh out                         # reference/GRCh38_chr1_8Mb.fa.gz (+ .fai, .gzi)
python3 02_genes_gff3.py out                     # reference/genes_GRCh38.gff3, reference/PER3_exons.bed
bash 03_dbsnp.sh out                             # reference/dbsnp157_per3_500kb.vcf.gz
bash 04_hprc.sh out                              # hprc/hprc_per3_vntr.vcf.gz, hprc/hprc_per3_500kb.vcf.gz
python3 05_samples.py out/hprc_per3_vntr.vcf.gz out   # hprc/hprc_samples.tsv, 1000g/1kgp_samples.tsv
bash 06_1000g.sh out                             # 1000g/1kgp_per3_gene.vcf.gz
bash 07_gwas.sh out                              # gwas/*_Jones2019.tsv and the other GWAS (several GB of downloads)
python3 08_gwas_catalog.py out                   # gwas/gwas_catalog_PER3_associations.tsv
python3 09_gtex.py out                           # gtex/GTEx_v8_PER3_rs228701.tsv
```

**Checked.** Scripts 01–06, 08 and 09 were run again on 21 October 2026 and gave the same files as those in
`data/examples/per3/` (the same sequence, the same records, the same rows; the GWAS Catalog's rows may come in another
order). `07_gwas.sh` downloads several gigabytes; it is the script that was used, run once.

## The primates

These files were made in steps, not by one script:

1. **Orthologues.** NCBI Datasets: the orthologues of human *PER3* (gene ID 8863; `api.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/v2/gene/id/8863/orthologs`, 510 species), and a data package of their gene regions (`gene.fna`) and proteins (`protein.faa`).
2. **The exon in the primates' genomes.** The human exon 19 (GRCh38 chr1:7,829,834–7,830,161) was searched against the gene regions of the primates with `blastn -task blastn` (E-value 10⁻²⁰); around the best hit of each, the exon and about 150 bases on each side were cut out, in the direction of the gene. These are the sequences of `PER3_repeat_exon_DNA.fa` named after a RefSeq chromosome (`reference_assembly`), with GRCh38's and CHM13's for human.
3. **The second haplotype of each ape.** `10_ape_haplotypes.py`: for the T2T assemblies of chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, both orangutans and the siamang (Yoo et al. 2025), the chromosome of the other haplotype that carries *PER3* is found by name, a 6-Mb window around the gene's expected position is fetched with E-utilities, and the human exon is found in it with BLAST. These are the sequences named `second_haplotype`.
4. **Proteins.** For each species chosen – the primates of step 2, the other primates and, for comparison, colugo, rodents, carnivores, cattle, opossum and chicken – the longest RefSeq protein of *PER3* in `protein.faa`: `PER3_proteins.fa`. `species.tsv` lists the species, their common names and groups, and the accession of each protein.
